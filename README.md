"Colt Express" is a multiplayer board game.  
My friends and I created an online adaption complete with a server that supports multiple remote concurrent users.  
My role in the project was to implement the properties and functionality of in game items.  

These are a copy of the scripts I worked on for the project "Colt Express".  
The full project is on a separate, private, GitHub repository.  
A demo or viewing of the full project can be provided upon request.
